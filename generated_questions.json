    "question": "At Westside High School, students can choose from 3 different styles of shirts (polo, button-up, or t-shirt) and 4 different colors of pants (black, navy, khaki, or gray) for their uniform. How many different uniform combinations are possible?",
    "instruction": "Calculate the total number of possible combinations.",
    "difficulty": "easy",
    "order": 1,
    "options": [
      "3 combinations",
      "4 combinations",
      "7 combinations",
      "12 combinations",
      "15 combinations"
    ],
    "correct_option": "12 combinations",
    "explanation": "To find the total number of possible uniform combinations, we multiply the number of shirt options by the number of pants options. There are 3 shirt options and 4 pants options, so the total number of possible combinations is 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 combinations.",

    "question": "A cylindrical container holds 8 identical spherical balls arranged in a 2\u00d72\u00d72 configuration. If each ball has a diameter of 3 centimeters, what is the minimum volume of the cylindrical container in cubic centimeters?",
    "instruction": "Calculate the minimum volume of the cylindrical container.",
    "difficulty": "moderate",
    "order": 2,
    "options": [
      "27\u03c0 cubic cm",

      "108\u03c0 cubic cm"
    ],
    "correct_option": "54\u03c0 cubic cm",
    "explanation": "For a 2\u00d72\u00d72 configuration of spherical balls, the minimum cylindrical container would have a diameter equal to twice the ball radius (3 cm) and a height equal to twice the ball radius (3 cm) multiplied by the number of layers (2). So the radius of the cylinder is 1.5 cm and the height is 6 cm. The volume of a cylinder is V = \u03c0r\u00b2h = \u03c0(1.5)\u00b2(6) = \u03c0(2.25)(6) = 13.5\u03c0 cubic cm.",
